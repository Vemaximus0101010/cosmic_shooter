# cosmic_shooter
A simple pygame game that represents an ordinary shooting game in space

To run, use the libraries pygame, pygame_menu, time, where time() is timer(), randint

How to play?
A - to the left
D - to the right
Left mouse button: weak bullet shot
Right mouse button: strong bullet shot
Each bullet has its own reload. I used line_bar for this.
